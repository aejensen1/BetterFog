BetterFog is a Mod Plugin that can be used on the game Lethal Company. If you have played the game, you may know how foggy weather is detrimental and even downright unplayable in essentially any other moon than Experimentation and Titan. BetterFog mod solves that issue by creating a preset list of fog options that can have custom densities, colors, and lighting settings. With this, there are virtually thousands of variations of custom fog presets possible.

To-Dos
==============
- Tune fog settings
- Change fog based on weather?
- Live modifications to fog in game for convenience

Instructions
==============
- If you are manually setting up the mod, place BetterFog.dll in "Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Lethal Company/BepInEx/plugins/BetterFog.dll"
- Manage presets in the config file. Any number of presets can be added, as long as there is at least one. Settings can be tweaked for fog density and color.
- hotkey 'n' is used to switch between presets in-game. LeftStickPress should be the button for controller, but this has not been tested yet.
